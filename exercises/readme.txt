Some random problems I found online that needs to be solved with bash.
1. Write a script that records, in a log, all the processes started after the script and specifies their parent.
2. Edit, recursively all the names of files in a directory from uppercase letters to lowercase.
3. Write a script that continuously show the time with seconds.
4. Write a script that draws a graph of the percentage of CPU that a process uses. Arguments should be a PID and optionally the sampling size.
5. Check directory specified by use for duplicate files even if they have different names.
6. Copy files in a directory into another directory while stopping for A seconds every B seconds. A and B are arguments.
